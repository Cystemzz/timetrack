# TimeTrack

An efficient and clean way to track time spent on jobs or projects.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `go mod download` and then `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide a hot reload of your changes.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

## Issues

Simply create an issue and I will try to get it patched up as soon as possible!
